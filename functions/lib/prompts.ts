    "A raw, documentary-style close-up photograph of a classroom. 
    The focal point is a large, slightly worn green blackboard with visible cloudy white eraser smudges and chalk residue on the surface. 
    Drawn on this textured surface is a masterpiece chalk art of ${name}. 
    The character is depicted in a dynamic pose, rendered with thick, dusty chalk strokes in vibrant colors (pink, yellow, bLue). 
    To the right, vertical Chinese text '${name}' is written in hand-written chalk calligraphy. 
    The foreground is out of focus, featuring the worn edge of an old wooden podium with a battered box of colorful chalks and scattered broken pieces. 
    In the corner, a stack of worn paper textbooks sits on a desk. 
    The lighting is natural window light, highlighting the matte, dusty texture of the board. 
    Realistic, nostalgic, high texture, 8k resolution, photorealistic."

    "A breathtaking low-angle photograph of a vast sky. 
    A massive, natural white cumulus cloud formation dominates the frame. 
    Through the phenomenon of pareidolia, the clouds coincidentally resemble the silhouette and form of ${name}. 
    The clouds are fluffy, soft, and volumetric, blending naturally with the surrounding sky. 
    Sunlight backlights the clouds, creating a glowing rim light around the edges. 
    At the very bottom of the frame, a small, realistic landscape anchors the image. 
    High dynamic range, 24mm wide-angle lens, photorealistic nature photography."
